Weapon Damage
----------------

The damage of a gun is calculated based on the ammo x barrel length. A longer barrel increases velocity of a bullet.
Distance affects damage drop off at larger distance, but in very close combat the enemy gets a penalty due to proximity of the blast from barrel.

Weapons Stats:
Bulkiness (how fast you can bring it to action or maneuver it)
Attachments (folding stock, laser, sights, silencer)
Magazine (Magazine capacity)
Rate of Fire ( the cyclic rate of the weapon)
Weight
Recoil is calculated based on the weight, bulkiness,rate of fire, and ammo type
Range depends on barrel length and ammo
Accuracy depends on barrel length and ammo, but maybe some guns can have a bonus such as extra accurate barrel

Ammo Stats:
Bullet Type (lead, FMJ, steel core, etc)
Caliber (9mm, 50cal)
Powder( black powder, smokeless, amount of powder, HP rounds)
