-ditto with firebomb which would nerf cyberdemons.
-rpg icon should no longer appear.
-Shotgun magazine reload now uses less intrusive sound file (old grenade launcher cocking sound).
-When using infinite ammo cheat, lantern should be infinite and weapon special functions should not deplete ammo.
-Battle Rifle added to weapons pack - fully compatible with modkits, starting from naked fal and ending with DMW-Fal.
-Regular CLIP pickups have a chance to spawn 9mm Autoloaders instead.

2.23-
-Fixes to enemy projectiles and bullet puffs by PlasmaZippo incorporated into pk3.
-Buff to FAL to balance and represent higher power of rarer .308 cartridge.
-First aid kids no longer affect secrets count.
-Sawed off shotgun no longer automatically reloads on empty, and can be reload-cancelled with altfire or switching weapon.

3.57 - 
-Added all weapons developed for Ashes: Hard Reset.
-Added a toggle within the options menu so you can control which weapons spawn - either Hard Reset weapons, Afterglow weapons, or both!
-Changed the lantern code so it handled by an external script rather than internal weapon spawners- should stop flickering now.
-Added the new Greaser weapon, which is an optional .45cal replacement for the Machine-pistol, with it's own upgrade path.
-Mod kits now spawn as a random chance replacement for backpacks, instead of replacing Blursphere(invisibility). This should make them more common.
-Blurspheres are now replaced by Black Water Vials. This (watered down :) ) variant of the chemical grants a permanent 25 point boost to max health, up to a maximum of 200.
-Buffed shotgun weapons and assault rifle weapons so that they remain viable later into the game and on maps with higher enemy counts.
-All flame stream weapons (the flamethrower attack from Master/Proto blasters) have been given the RIPPER effect, allowing them to deal damage to crowds more effectively.
-Expanded HUD to show 40mm HE grenades and crossbow bolts as available ammo.
-FAL now uses 5.56mm, same as the other rifles, in order to reduce bloat and spawn chance issues. Sadness...
